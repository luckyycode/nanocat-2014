# nanocat-2014

this is some random version my old engine development, not in production.. development got abandoned for the several reasons:
1. it's monolithic, not really cool, no plugin stuff
2. code is sorta messy, I don't like that
3. more

currently I am developing a more sophisticated version of this, a brand new Neko Engine/framework from scratch, probably will be uploaded here in my repositories in the near future.


you can find all the source code in /test/ folder

what that stuff got so far:
1. opengl 3.2 core renderer with some bits of Metal support
2. txaa.. 
3. pbr.. 
4. hdr... 
5. histogram based hdr..
6. lens.. 
7. physically correct fog fx.. 
8. filmic motion blur 
9. percentage-closer soft shadows (just like Fallout 4)
10. quadtree-based terrain LOD
11. some bits of multiplayer code
12. cpu-based fft ocean (based on some docs... I don't really remember but it works)
13. openal sound system
14. async asset loading
15. dynamic day-night time environment
16. some basic clouds
17. superduper basic ui menu stuff
