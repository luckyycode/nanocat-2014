# nanocat-2014

this is some random version my old engine development, not in production.. development got abandoned for the several reasons:
1. it's monolithic, not really cool, no plugin stuff
2. code is sorta messy, I don't like that
3. more

currently I am developing a more sophisticated version of this, a brand new Neko Engine/framework from scratch, probably will be uploaded here in my repositories in the near future.


you can find all the source code in /test/ folder
